Memory-Accumulator-Simulator
The Memory Accumulator Simulator is a C-based project designed to replicate core features of an operating system’s memory management system. It supports dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory for multiple processes, each assigned a unique PID for identification and tracking. Memory is organized as a linked list of blocks, storing key attributes such as start address, size, and free/allocated status. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is used to implement the Best-Fit allocation strategy, ensuring efficient space utilization by selecting the smallest suitable free block. A hash table provides constant-time lookup for PID-to-block mapping, enabling fast access and deletion operations. A graph structure represents parent–child process relationships, supporting cascading deallocation so that freeing a parent automatically frees all dependent child processes. A memory compaction mechanism reorganizes occupied blocks to eliminate gaps and minimize fragmentation, maintaining optimal use of the simulated memory space. The system offers a clear and structured memory map display, showing start addresses, block sizes, and free/allocated status in an easy-to-read format. The overall design provides an interactive and educational simulation of memory allocation strategies, process relationships, fragmentation behavior, and space optimization in modern operating systems.
